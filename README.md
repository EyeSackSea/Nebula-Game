# Nebula-Game
I made a game in unity! Yippee!

It's a very simple bullet hell that was basically just me learning how to code in unity lol
Kinda the capstone for the unity course I'm taking, although this is definitely a personal thing
I mean it's called Personal Poject smh
Anyways you're a spaceship that consists of 3 polygons total
Fight the evil vortex nebula circle thing
I did not think this through
Byeeeeeee!
